# NumPy Image Manipulation and Linear Algebra Practice

Welcome to my **NumPy Image Manipulation** and **Linear Algebra** practice repository! This is where you can practice hands-on exercises with **NumPy** and experiment with image manipulation, matrix operations, and linear algebra in Python.

## üßë‚Äçüíª What‚Äôs Inside?

In this repository, you‚Äôll find:

- **Exercises** related to **NumPy arrays**, **image manipulation**, and **linear algebra** concepts.
- Solutions for each exercise to help you understand how to apply **NumPy** to real-world tasks.
- Step-by-step explanations on how to **manipulate images** (flipping, rotating, converting to grayscale) and perform linear algebra operations like **matrix multiplication**.

## üîç How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**  
   To get started, you can clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file.  
```git clone https://github.com/faisal-khrisan/numpy-image-manipulation.git```


Alternatively, click the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP."

2. **Requirements**
